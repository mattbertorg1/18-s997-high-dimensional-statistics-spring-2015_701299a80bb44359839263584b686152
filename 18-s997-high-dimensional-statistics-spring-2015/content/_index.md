This course offers an introduction to the finite sample analysis of high- dimensional statistical methods. The goal is to present various proof techniques for state-of-the-art methods in regression, matrix estimation and principal component analysis (PCA) as well as optimality guarantees. The course ends with research questions that are currently open.
